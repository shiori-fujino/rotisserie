        I couldnâ€™t stand the ugly, eye-hurting rosters out there, so I built this
        so you donâ€™t have to.

        How it works

      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        Every day, my Python scripts scrape roster data from shop websites.
        That data gets saved into a database, and then this web app fetches it
        for you.

        The real-world problem
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" paragraph>
        The shops you see here at least have some kind of structure on their
        sites. But many others donâ€™t â€” or worse, they donâ€™t even bother with a
        roster page. Thatâ€™s like a restaurant website without a menu. Crazy,
        right?

        This is an indie project, built spare-time with stubbornness, coffee,
        and chicken jokes. Itâ€™s not official, but itâ€™s here to make life easier.
        Enjoy the spin ðŸ”„.

  And hey, donâ€™t come at me about the design looking like a
  highschoolerâ€™s summer project. Strong structure and data come first.
  Sleek animations and sprinkles can wait. If it works, it works. ðŸ˜Ž
