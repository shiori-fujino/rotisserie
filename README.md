# 🍗 The Rotisserie
### $3x Shop (Brothel) Roster Aggregator

**Disclaimer:** $3x work in Sydney, Australia is fully legal, regulated, and protected.

## Why this exists
Because the old-ass $ex forums are trash.  
- Bad design  
- Confusing UX  
- BBCode (yes, *phpBB*… what year is it??)  
- Harassing people instead of helping  

All people wanted was to check who’s working today without clicking 50 posts. So I built it.  

---

## What it does
- 🐍 **Python scrapers** → pull rosters from shop websites  
- ⚛️ **React + Vite frontend** → display them nicely  
- 🤷 **TypeScript** → idk tbh but it works  

---

## Real world problem
- Shops upload rosters in unreadable formats  
- Forums make it *even worse*  
- Users just want photos + availability in one glance  

---

## My solution
- Filter by **shop** or **nationality** (or both!)  
- Roster shown in a **Pinterest-style grid**  
- Shuffle button → refresh lineup instantly  
- Straightforward, no bullshit: *“who’s working today”*  

---

## Tech stack
- **Backend**: Python, Express, Postgres  
- **Frontend**: React, Vite, TypeScript  
- **Hosting**: Railway + Vercel  

---

## Roadmap
- [ ] Add more shops (currently scraping 6, ~100+ girls)  
- [ ] SEO optimisation  
- [ ] Merch? (Rotisserie chicken jumper kek)

## Demo
